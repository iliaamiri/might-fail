 * an object that either contains a 'result' value of type T (if successful), or an 'error' of type Error.
 *
 * @template T The type of the result value.

// Note this array interface is undesireable, we would much rather use just an itterator here but TS doesn't yet support that well enough
// So it has an array interface and proxies array methods.
